# AI6GS-Handle-Talkie
This is the repo for my AI6GS dual band Handle Talkie.

The idea behind the Handle Talkie is to squeeze a low power dual band FM transceiver into a Handle for the Elk log periodic antenna that is commonly used for working amateur radio satellites. By nature the Elk is very portable but generally the equipment it is connected to is a tangle of wires, radios and other equipment. I had the thought to simplify this by making the transceiver part of the antenna assembly.

The hardware I will be using are VHF and UHF transceiver modules from Dorji. For microprocessor control I will be using an Adafruit Fether M0 Wifi. Power will be supplied by a 5200 mAh Li Ni pack with integrated charging circuit. The enclosure will be a length of 1-1/2" PVC pipe that works well with the 1/2" PVC pipe found on the Elk.

The end goal is to be able to plug a headset into the end of the handle, turn it on, point and make QSO's. Depending upon how it all works out I may even go the Bluetooth route for audio for a completely wireless system with ultimate portability. I'm expecting performance to be pretty low compared to commercial equipment but as long as I can make a single QSO then mission accomplished.
